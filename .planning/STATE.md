# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-15)

**Core value:** One command to deploy a fully working development server with all services running, all tools installed, and all infrastructure repos cloned -- no manual setup steps.
**Current focus:** Phase 10 IN PROGRESS — parts deployment pipeline. Plan 10-01 complete, Plan 10-02 next.

## Current Position

Phase: 10 (Parts Deployment Pipeline) — IN PROGRESS
Plan: 1 of 2 — COMPLETE (10-01)
Status: Flake inputs switched to github:, deploy script created, runbook written. Next: Plan 10-02 (end-to-end deploy test).
Last activity: 2026-02-17 - Completed Plan 10-01 (inputs + deploy script + runbook)

Progress: Plan 10-01 complete (4/4 tasks); Plan 10-02 next (deploy + verify)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 15
- Average duration: ~18min
- Total execution time: ~270 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 2/2 | ~13min | ~6.5min |
| 2 | 1/2 | ~5min | ~5min |
| 3 | 2/2 | ~15min | ~7.5min |
| 3.1 | 3/3 | ~75min | ~25min |
| 4 | 2/2 | ~60min | ~30min |
| 5 | 2/2 | ~37min | ~18.5min |
| 6 | 2/2 | ~40min | ~20min |

| 10 | 1/2 | ~25min | ~25min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 2 plans: 06-02 (15min), 10-01 (25min)
- Trend: Orchestrator direct execution for NixOS-specific work

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [06-01]: Syncthing GUI binds 0.0.0.0:8384, restricted via trustedInterfaces (not IP binding)
- [06-01]: allowUnfreePredicate for claude-code added to base.nix (pre-existing Phase 5 issue)
- [06-02]: CASS v0.1.64 binary via fetchurl + autoPatchelfHook
- [06-02]: Repo cloning is clone-only (never pull/update) to protect dirty working trees
- [06-02]: mkOutOfStoreSymlink for whole-directory ~/.claude and ~/.codex symlinks
- [Phase quick-001]: Use fetchurl of pre-built zmx static binary instead of flake input (zig2nix bwrap incompatible with apparmor)
- [10-01]: Manual deploy only — no CI/CD, NixOS handles incrementality
- [10-01]: Full nixos-rebuild switch every deploy — no partial/container-only path
- [10-01]: Container health polling (30s) — no app-level health checks
- [10-01]: No auto-commit of flake.lock — print reminder instead

### Completed Phases

- **Phase 1: Flake Scaffolding + Pre-Deploy** (2 plans, completed 2026-02-13)
- **Phase 2: Bootable Base System** (2/2 plans, completed 2026-02-15)
- **Phase 2.1: Base System Fixups** — Absorbed into Phase 9
- **Phase 3: Networking + Secrets + Docker Foundation** (2 plans, completed 2026-02-15)
- **Phase 3.1: Parts Integration** (3 plans, completed 2026-02-15)
- **Phase 8: Review Old Neurosys + Doom.d** (1 plan, completed 2026-02-15)
- **Phase 9: Audit & Simplify** (2 plans, completed 2026-02-15)
- **Phase 4: Docker Services** (2 plans, completed 2026-02-16)
- **Phase 5: User Environment + Dev Tools** (2 plans, completed 2026-02-16)
- **Phase 6: User Services + Agent Tooling** (2 plans, completed 2026-02-16)
  - 06-01: Syncthing declarative module (4 devices, 1 folder, staggered versioning, Tailscale-only GUI)
  - 06-02: CASS binary + timer, repo cloning activation, agent config symlinks

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 10 added: Parts Deployment Pipeline — Research + Implementation (understand current parts deployment, implement agent-neurosys-owned deploy flow)

### Blockers/Concerns

- [RESOLVED]: CASS binary availability — v0.1.64 fetched and patched successfully
- [RESOLVED]: Contabo uses BIOS boot (i386-pc GRUB installed successfully), eth0 confirmed
- [RESOLVED]: Secrets deployed and decrypted — 15 secrets in /run/secrets/
- [RESOLVED]: Phase 2.1 scope creep — absorbed into Phase 9 after re-evaluation
- [NOTE]: Syncthing device IDs are placeholders — user must replace before deploy
- [NOTE]: home-manager ssh/git options show deprecation warnings (renamed options) — cosmetic, not blocking

### Quick Tasks Completed

| # | Description | Date | Commit | Directory |
